# CP/M 2.2 Supervisor Binaries

The `cpm.bin.base64` and `bios.bin.base64` payloads were derived from
the canonical binaries generated by the `cpmsim/srccpm2` tree in
[z80pack](https://github.com/udo-munk/z80pack) commit
`91fd28eb04e675c2127df88ed3f40675e15282e2`. The source material is part
of the open CP/M 2.2 release published by DRDOS, Inc. under the terms
described in Bryan Sparks' 2022 licensing clarification. The
clarification grants a non-exclusive right to "use, distribute, modify,
enhance, and otherwise make available" CP/M and derivative works.

The base64 text provides the canonical CCP/BDOS pair (decoded into
`cpm.bin`, loaded at `0xDC00`) and BIOS stub (decoded into `bios.bin`,
loaded at `0xFA00`) used by the system image regression exercise. The
test harness decodes them into temporary binaries at runtime so the
repository can avoid storing opaque binary blobs while still running the
regression offline.

The original release notice is archived by the
[Unofficial CP/M Web Site](http://www.gaby.de/cpm/license.html) and is
also mirrored in
[`cpmish/third_party/dr/COPYING.md`](https://github.com/davidgiven/cpmish/blob/65784f9a485cb1fcbe045b2325405cb9184160a2/third_party/dr/COPYING.md)
